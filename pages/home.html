<p>On Sunday, March 22nd 1992 at 1605 hours IST a star broke and an alien turned into a human at 24&deg;12&rsquo; N, 82&deg;46&rsquo; E. The alien was named Kaushal Kumar. And that is my story</p>

<p>If I were to exclude the planet, everything in my life is damn perfect. I look quite silly sometimes though. I have the world best parents. I am blessed with the goddamn friends. I always ever have had the rock star teams to work with and I always had the best instruments and the tools to the chisel the mountain and break it into pieces.</p>

<p>This work is just to motivate people with a fact that a man who hasn&rsquo;t achieved anything great in his life, yet works hard and dreams that he will return again to his place among the stars. I have started this project to thank all the people who helped me wherever I am.</p>

<p>Thank You mom and Dad,<br />
Thanks Love,<br />
Thanks All,</p>

<p>Godspeed<br />
