<p>I am cursed with life, but blessed with teams.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Short, Lean, Thin and yet hard edged energetic, that would be a befitting reply that a person would give once anyone enquires about me to her/him. And that is the identity of this anti-hero. Ever since my inception on this planet, I have seen stuffs and folks evolving into something better and I have seen myself as the one standing on the edge as a timekeeper. Whosoever they were, one fact still stands tall viz., they were all great people. I am cursed with life but blessed with teams.</p>

<p>I am Kaushal Kumar and I wear plain tees. I am a Mechanical Engineer and a Mathematics Enthusiast. But why I do describe myself in a weird manner. I do because I feel proud to work with the best minds of the planet who taught me the meaning of science and Mathematics. I work with the finest talents of all times.</p>

<p>I am very much excited about the Machines also apart from learning more about mathematics. I love the sound of the motors. I love high pressures and temperatures, structures with high vibrations, highly toxic containers. If there is a world that I would love, it would be any industrial zone where we design machines using the equations and the numerically controlled machines. I would love to die in that world.</p>

<p>I want to see a fully literate world and would be me more than happy to volunteer towards this very need of the hour. I want to stand in the corner of a big auditorium and see the poorest of all speaking and the richest ones taking notes from them. If it is Education and Mathematics, I want every part of the world having a common anthem of liberation. I want to see this planet unleash and rise.</p>
