<p>The rough and wild in the woods.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When I first entered into this building, I wasn&rsquo;t aware that this was going to be the best and most magical experience of my life. A place located in the adobe of nature, Shri Mata Vaisho Devi University is culmination of technology, diversity, education, philosophy and Mathematics. It is much more than what any other typical indian university would offer. </p>

<p>I graduated in true sense, for I came across a dedicated workforce of professors, a group of motivated students, state of art infrastructure, and most importantly I learnt the basic meaning of life. This place taught me that true happiness lies in giving but not taking. This place had a streak of peace in the air and there was an inner solace that made its presence the moment one entered into. </p>

<p>I may have learnt some laws and equations, but what I learnt there defines me and my identity. The laws and equations are helping me find bread for me and my family, but the values are helping me to find my own self. </p>

<p>One of the best things that ever happened to me were the most dear ones, my friends. With the motto &ndash;&ldquo;My life has been full of terrible misfortunes most of which never happened.&rdquo;, this small bunch of to-be-Mechanical Engineers were full of energy and passion. What drives them can make people go nuts. I am proud to have these people in my life. I have been an incredibly terrible boy since my childhood and it takes lot of strength and courage to work with a person like me. Today all of these wise men are working at different places of the world, and making their university proud. My classmates will always be a source of motivation. M friends are men of grit, power and values. They are the source of light that guides the stars around the heavenly planet. </p>

<p>This mention would be very discourteous, if I fail to jot down the role of my professors in my life. Being the constant source of motivation , my professors were always at stones throw for guiding me through the ups and downs of my life. I am blessed in true sense to have my teachers in my life. Whether it is dedication or discipline, they form the spine of my values. My professors not only made me learn form the technical point of view but also from philosophical point of view. This life is great and the reasons are my professors. I cannot ever thank them much for all the things that they did to me.</p>
