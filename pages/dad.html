<p>The people who never got tired of me.</p>

<p>Bringing up a child like me deserves a certificate and that it should be offered to my parents. I may give up for my cursed life, but these two will never do. </p>

<p>Ever since my birth, my parents tried their level best to inculcate the best virtues and values in my life. My whole life I have seen them sacrificing their happiness and comfort for their kids and I cant never repay them back.</p>

<p>I got the best parents in the whole world. They made sure that they bring me up with all the care and love that a child so be given to.</p>

<p>And yes, I was thrashed very badly my whole childhood and I am proud that I was. My evolution into what I am today is the result of rigorous efforts of my parents. I can never thank them enough. I am blessed to have them as my parents.</p>

<p>I thank my lord for having such wonderful parents.</p>

<p>Thank you Lord.<br />
