<p>After stepping out of my University, I was standing all alone, unaware of the all the atrocities that I was going to encounter. The planet earth is very nasty, cruel and a sadist place with no active memory and heart. This world makes the most majestic to kneel down and crawl like the pests.</p>

<p>And I was just an another ordinary guy. The fate was waiting to play its part. The marooned life was waiting just outside on the other street down the lane. I walked past that and it joined my hands to suffer.</p>

<p>May be I will never have something that is called life. This is the sheer reality of my life. The different phases started falling like the deck of cards and I started to lose every bit of it. The pain of the sufferings made me stubborn and I decided to fight with it.</p>

<p>I know that I will never see the sunshine again, but it works for me. Sometimes we work for others and today my family needs are bigger that my dreams. I feel bad that I had to kill all my dreams and chose the path that I decided not to. Today I visit my family once a year and what I find is the smile on their faces. They will never know what I feel and what I want in my life. I want to express my feelings and I want it badly. Sometimes I wake up quite early in the morning and gaze the sky where sun rises and stars fade. My life misses all of them. All I wish is that people should understand me more than a television anchor hosting a discovery channel show. I am not Google Search Engine. Sometimes it looks funny and brings smile to my face. I understand people and know that they will never understand me.</p>

<p>I want to deliver the best. I want to work for people and want to see the world developing and growing. I want to unleash and liberate. I want to rise.</p>
