<p>I Love You</p>

<hr/>

<p>The most important theory of life is love. Without love everything is lifeless. Eros, agape, philia, storge, ludus and pragma are just to name some. They all create focus and passion in the life. Sapiosexual passion is the intimate form of acquisitive love which is driven by the intelligence of the other person and I love someone&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>

<p>She is the most amazing and the most wonderful experience that I ever had. She defines my identity and motivates me to work like a woodcutter who cuts logs in the woods. The woodcutter cut the logs in the woods by striking a sharp axe at a single point multiple times.</p>

<p>Unluckily, she couldn&rsquo;t stay in my life due to some unforeseen reasons. Her absence in my life cannot convince me to hate her. I love her and will always do. She is the sole motivation of my life. There isn&rsquo;t a single moment that passes by and I don&rsquo;t think about her. </p>

<p>I know that it is impossible for her to come back and I got no option but to love her and wait for her. The world is a sadist, cruel, and a cold blooded place without mercy. But she made me learn the lesson of brightening the world by burning the self in the profane fire of love.</p>

<p>I will work hard till my last breath and embrace the deity of death with peace in the heart and smile on the face. I promise that I will lay down my life to make this world a more beautiful place.</p>

<p>I cannot thank her enough for teaching me the best and the most beautiful lessons of my life.</p>

<p>I miss her. Someday I will meet her and will tell her- &ldquo;I Love You.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Godspeed</p>
