<p> It was never nothing about me </p>

<hr />

<p>One has both perks and perils of being born and brought up in an Indian Orthodox Hindu Brahmin family and I am no exception to it. Right from the beginning I was taught the lessons of discipline and hard work. My childhood was filled with the stories of grit, dedication, inspirations and determination to do any task.</p>

<p>My Grandfather being a very strict person would not tolerate any misdeed and was very particular about time. Apart from instilling the values, he worked very hard throughout his life to bring the best out of his grandchildren. And this is the story of both my maternal and paternal grandfather. I am just an output of all the hard work put by these gentleman.</p>

<p>My childhood was primarily centered around the town Anpara. I was born an brought up at this place. Once I grew, I was kicked to study into St. Francis Senior Secondary School Anpara, where I completed My High School and Intermediate Examinations. My Teachers along with my parents taught me the lessons and the hardships that I would face after stepping out the compound one day. They taught me the lesson that the world is very bad place and I would survive a moment if I depend for someone to spoon-feed me. They tried to bring the best of me using every resources under their reach. Me and my friends being the obedient kids and under the constant of punishments evolved into fresh lumps which were soon ready with their swords to fight every wrong thing in this world. My school taught me the meaning of discipline and this value will go down with me the day I go down.</p>

<p>After completing my schooling I was at the city of Varanasi for a year to prepare my Engineering Entrance Exams. This city was the first experience where I was away from my friends and family. This city made me realize that being Kaushal I can work hard and bring my best for the development of the society I thrive in. With many ups and downs, this phase simply passed away.</p>

<p>I am just an ordinary character trapped in some extraordinary situations. And my childhood was in no exception to that. Whether it was my home or my school, I had seen all things but the beautiful ones were still to arrive.</p>
